            <p> <IMG SRC="assets/images/city.jpg" class="myimage" alt="Lovdeep Mander"> My name is Lovdeep Mander, I was born in Yuba City, California.  
                    When I was 5 I moved to Livingston, California, about 2 hours south, where I went to school and graduated High School.
                    After high school I attendated CSU Sacramento, where I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Operations Management and Marketing.
            </p>
            <p>After graduating I had an opportunity to work at Foster Farms, where I have been the last 10 years.  I have held
                a few different postions inside the production plant.  I started off at a Supervisor overseeing 90 employees, 
                currently I am a Department Supervisor for the shipping/receving areas.  Currently I have 4 supervisors and 120 employees
                I oversee.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I started the coding bootcamp program in November of 2018, it is something that
                interested me very much, so I am planning a career change.  Currently we are working on HTML and CSS to create a website.
